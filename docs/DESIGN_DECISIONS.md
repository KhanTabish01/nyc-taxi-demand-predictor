## Purpose
Document the why behind key choices so future you/interviewers can see the trade-offs and constraints. Keep entries short and dated.

## How to add an entry
1) State the decision and date.
2) List 2–3 options considered.
3) Note constraints (data size, time, infra limits).
4) Record the rationale and what would change the decision later.

## Current assumptions (fill these in)
- Data volume assumption: <todo>
- Target latency for inference: <todo>
- Update cadence for new data: <todo>
